                1. Core Computing Consepts</a>
        </h1>
        <p>This module covers four foundational topics central to a broad understanding of the discipline of 
                    computing science and for developing computing systems. Each topic will be covered over a six week block,
                    knowledge gained will be applied during several later modules and, depending on a student's degree programme, 
                    will be developed further. An exploration of the history, major advances and trends in computing are discussed 
                    to give students a context for subsequent study. 
                    Foundations of computer system usability and cyber security are covered during the next two blocks. 
                    The final block introduces a technology that is specific to the student's degree course, 
                    but which is not covered in a dedicated module elsewhere at level 4.

            </h1>
        <p>This module will equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the theory behind relational database design. 
                    Special emphasis will be placed on developing databases using Crow's Foot Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) and SQL, 
                    tools that are crucial in the creation of databases.

                3. Practical Data Science</a>
        </h1>
        <p>Data science requires a multidisciplinary approach. This involves introducing students to a broad range of core concepts,
                    statistical methods and techniques that underpin data science. This module will explore and apply the foundational
                    topics in data science, namely: data manipulation, data analytics and statistics. This module will help students 
                    have a better understanding of data analytics and to be able to locate, access and critically engage with data and 
                    information, using current and emerging digital technologies.

                4. Architectyre and Operating Systems</a>
            </h1>
        <p>This module provides an introduction to the underlying logical structure of computer systems. It emphasises the logical and 
                    theoretical concepts upon which computing systems are physically constructed. Within this module the underpinning 
                    decision logic of computer systems is developed alongside an understanding of operating systems.The module aims 
                    include: To engage students with the logical concepts that form the basis of computer architectures and organisation, 
                    to engage students with the development and functions, architecture and processes of the CPU, to engage students with 
                    the development and functions, architecture and processes of operating system software, and to examine the use of 
                    algorithms in operating system software.</p>

        </h1>
        <p>The information here is designed to help you be more productive: we want all students to be able to make full
                    use of the accessibility and inclusion benefits of our digital content. As well as telling you what works, 
                    we want to offer you the channels to let us know what needs to be improved. That way, you can let us know 
                    in advance if we need to work together to provide information in an alternative format. For more information

                6. Programming 1</a>
        </h1>
        <p>This module covers the theory and practice of developing computer programs, focussing on algorithm development and 
                    procedural programming. The module provides the student with guidance and support to enable them to 
                    increase their knowledge and skills in programming irrespective of their starting point. Techniques of program design 
                    are taught alongside the Python programming language.</p>
